SVM Regression is a machine learning technique that uses Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to perform regression tasks. SVMs are models that can learn complex patterns from data and make predictions based on them. SVMs can use different types of kernels, which are functions that measure the similarity between data points. Some common kernels are 

1. Linear
2. Polynomial
3. Radial basis function (RBF)
4. Sigmoid


SVM Regression works by finding a function that fits the data points as closely as possible, while also minimizing the error within a certain margin (called epsilon). The function is represented by a linear combination of support vectors, which are the data points that lie on or near the margin. The coefficients of the support vectors are determined by solving an optimization problem that balances the trade-off between the accuracy and the complexity of the function.


SVM can be used for a variety of applications that involve classification or regression problems. Some examples are:

Face detection: SVM can classify parts of an image as face or non-face and create a square boundary around the face. This can be useful for security, biometrics, or entertainment purposes

Text and hypertext categorization: SVM can classify documents into different categories based on their content, such as news articles, emails, or web pages. This can be useful for information retrieval, filtering, or analysis

Image classification: SVM can classify images into different categories based on their features, such as animals, plants, or objects. This can be useful for image search, recognition, or understanding

Bioinformatics: SVM can classify genes, proteins, or diseases based on their biological characteristics. This can be useful for diagnosis, treatment, or research

Handwriting recognition: SVM can recognize handwritten characters based on their shapes and strokes. This can be useful for digitization, authentication, or education

Generalized predictive control: SVM can control chaotic systems based on their inputs and outputs. This can be useful for engineering, physics, or economics

These are just some of the examples of where SVM can be used. 

In my example I have used a very small data set to illustriate the SVM
